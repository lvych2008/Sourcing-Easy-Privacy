# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-5-29  
**Last Updated:** 2025-5-29

We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Chrome extension ("the Extension").

## Information We Collect

### 1. Local Data Storage

The Extension uses the chrome.storage API to store the following data locally in your browser only:

- **User Identifiers:** such as client_id and access_token, which are used to authenticate API requests.
- **User Preferences:** including interface and usage settings, for a seamless experience.

We do not transmit this data to our servers.

All data remains on your local device and is used solely to enhance your user experience.

### 2. Functional Permissions

The Extension requires access to the following domain:

- https://ocrtranfunction-ocr-tra-service-taijrfcxuz.cn-hangzhou.fcapp.run/*

This endpoint is provided by Alibaba Cloud Function Compute and is used for image text recognition and translation (OCR + translation). Access to this domain is essential for the core functionality of the Extension.

We do not collect or log your browsing activity.

## How We Use Information

- To provide image text translation functionality.
- To remember your preferences and reduce repetitive setup.
- To ensure authentication when accessing remote services via API.

We do not share or sell your information to third parties. We do not use your data for advertising or profiling purposes.

## Your Privacy Rights

### For EU Users (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Union, you have the right to:

- Request access to and correction of your personal data.
- Request deletion of your local data stored by the extension.
- Withdraw consent at any time by uninstalling the Extension.

### For California Residents (CCPA)

We do not sell your data. However, under CCPA, you have the right to:

- Request deletion of any stored personal information (note: we do not store anything on our servers).
- Opt out of the sale of personal data (not applicable as we do not sell data).

## Security

We implement reasonable technical measures to protect any data stored locally via Chrome APIs. As we do not collect data on our servers, your privacy is preserved by design.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on the Extension's listing page or accompanying documentation. Continued use of the Extension after updates indicates your acceptance of the changes.
